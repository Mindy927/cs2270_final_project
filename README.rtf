load_data.py is for collecting input data. You can put any company you want in tickers and use close.loc[:,[company name]] to get the close price for each day. 

In head_and_shoulder.py, we define a simple head and shoulder shape curve.

Qetch.py is where we reimplement qetch. The fx(x) is where we define the target input, the change in this function also leads to the change in the parameter pass in the con_to_dis function. The end is the end point of the target shape. For example, we use 2*pi as the end point for cos(x) and sin(x) and 61 for head and shoulder.
